When you access third-party websites or use third-party services, you accept that there are risks in doing so, and that Canopy is not responsible for such risks. We encourage you to be aware when you leave the Services and to read the terms and conditions and privacy policy of each third-party website or service that you visit or utilize. By using the Services, you release and hold us harmless from any and all liability arising from your use of any third-party website or service.<br/></p><p>Your interactions with organizations and/or individuals found on or through the Services, including payment and delivery of goods or services, and any other terms, conditions, warranties or representations associated with such dealings, are solely between you and such organizations and/or individuals. You should make whatever investigation you feel necessary or appropriate before proceeding with any online or offline transaction with any of these third parties. You agree that Canopy shall not be responsible or liable for any loss or damage of any sort incurred as the result of any such dealings.<br/></p><p>You release, to the fullest extent permitted by law, Canopy, its directors, officers, members, employees, representatives, consultants, agents, supplies, and/or distributors from responsibility, liability, claims, demands, and/or damages (actual and consequential) of every kind and nature, known and unknown, arising out of or in any way connected with the following:<br/></p><ul><li><div>Disputes between or among Users, including without limitation those between you and other Users; and</div></li><li><div>Third party sites and services, including without limitation content found on such sites and services.</div></li></ul><p>You hereby waive California Civil Code Section 1542 or any similar law of any jurisdiction, which says in substance: “A general release does not extend to claims that the creditor or releasing party does not know or suspect to exist in his or her favor at the time of executing the release and that, if known by him or her, would have materially affected his or her settlement with the debtor or released party.”<br/></p><h4>Limitation of Liability</h4><p>TO THE FULLEST EXTENT ALLOWED BY APPLICABLE LAW, UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES AND UNDER NO LEGAL THEORY (INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, TORT, CONTRACT, STRICT LIABILITY, OR OTHERWISE) SHALL ANY OF THE CANOPY PARTIES BE LIABLE TO YOU OR TO ANY OTHER PERSON FOR (A) ANY INDIRECT, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, PUNITIVE OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES OF ANY KIND, INCLUDING DAMAGES FOR LOST PROFITS, BUSINESS INTERRUPTION, LOSS OF DATA, LOSS OF GOODWILL, WORK STOPPAGE, ACCURACY OF RESULTS, OR COMPUTER FAILURE OR MALFUNCTION, (B) ANY SUBSTITUTE GOODS, SERVICES OR TECHNOLOGY, (C) ANY AMOUNT, IN THE AGGREGATE, IN EXCESS OF THE GREATER OF (I) ONE-HUNDRED ($100) DOLLARS OR (II) THE AMOUNTS PAID AND/OR PAYABLE BY YOU TO CANOPY IN CONNECTION WITH THE SERVICES IN THE TWELVE (12) MONTH PERIOD PRECEDING THIS APPLICABLE CLAIM OR (D) ANY MATTER BEYOND OUR REASONABLE CONTROL. SOME STATES DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OR LIMITATION OF INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL OR CERTAIN OTHER DAMAGES, SO THE ABOVE LIMITATION AND EXCLUSIONS MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.</p><h4>Indemnity</h4><p>You agree to indemnity and hold the Canopy Parties harmless from and against any and all claims, liabilities, damages (actual and consequential), losses and expenses (including attorneys’ fees) arising from or in any way related to any claims relating to (a) your use of the Services, and (b) your violation of these Terms. In the event of such a claim, suit, or action (“Claim”), we will attempt to provide notice of the Claim to the contact information we have for your account (provided that failure to deliver such notice shall not eliminate or reduce your indemnification obligations hereunder).</p><h4>Choice of Law</h4><p>We at Canopy encourage you to contact us if you’re having an issue at hello@canopy.cr, before resorting to the courts. In the unfortunate situation where legal action does arise, these Terms (and all other rules, policies, or guidelines incorporated by reference) are governed by and will be construed under the Federal Arbitration Act, applicable federal law, and the laws of the State of New York, without regard to the conflicts of laws provisions thereof.</p><h4>Arbitration Agreement; Waiver of Class Actions</h4><p>Please read the following ARBITRATION AGREEMENT carefully because it requires you to arbitrate certain disputes and claims with Canopy and limits the manner in which you can seek relief from Canopy. Both you and Canopy acknowledge and agree that for the purposes of any dispute arising out of or relating to the subject matter of these Terms, Canop&#x27;s officers, directors, employees and independent contractors (“Personnel”) are third-party beneficiaries of these Terms, and that upon your acceptance of these Terms, Personnel will have the right (and will be deemed to have accepted the right) to enforce these Terms against you as the third-party beneficiary hereof.</p><p><em>(a) Arbitration Rules; Applicability of Arbitration Agreement</em>. The parties shall use their best efforts to settle any dispute, claim, question, or disagreement arising out of or relating to the subject matter of these Terms directly through good-faith negotiations, which shall be a precondition to either party initiating arbitration. If such negotiations do not resolve the dispute, it shall be finally settled by binding arbitration in New York County, New York. The arbitration will proceed in the English language, in accordance with the JAMS Streamlined Arbitration Rules and Procedures (the “Rules”) then in effect, by one commercial arbitrator with substantial experience in resolving intellectual property and commercial contract disputes. The arbitrator shall be selected from the appropriate list of JAMS arbitrators in accordance with such Rules. Judgment upon the award rendered by such arbitrator may be entered in any court of competent jurisdiction.</p><p><em>(b) Costs of Arbitration. </em>The Rules will govern payment of all arbitration fees. Canop will pay all arbitration fees for claims less than seventy-five thousand ($75,000) dollars. Canopy will not seek its attorneys’ fees and costs in arbitration unless the arbitrator determines that your claim is frivolous.</p><p><em>(c) Small Claims Court; Infringement. </em>Either you or Canopy may assert claims, if they qualify, in small claims court in New York County, New York or any United States county where you live or work. Furthermore, notwithstanding the foregoing obligation to arbitrate disputes, each party shall have the right to pursue injunctive or other equitable relief at any time, from any court of competent jurisdiction, to prevent the actual or threatened infringement, misappropriation or violation of a party&#x27;s copyrights, trademarks, trade secrets, patents or other intellectual property rights.</p><p><em>(d) Waiver of Jury Trial. </em>YOU AND CANOPY WAIVE ANY CONSTITUTIONAL AND STATUTORY RIGHTS TO GO TO COURT AND HAVE A TRIAL IN FRONT OF A JUDGE OR JURY. You and Canopy are instead choosing to have claims and disputes resolved by arbitration. Arbitration procedures are typically more limited, more efficient, and less costly than rules applicable in court and are subject to very limited review by a court. In any litigation between you and Canopy over whether to vacate or enforce an arbitration award, YOU AND CANOPY WAIVE ALL RIGHTS TO A JURY TRIAL, and elect instead to have the dispute be resolved by a judge.</p><p><em>(e) Waiver of Class or Consolidated Actions.</em> ALL CLAIMS AND DISPUTES WITHIN THE SCOPE OF THIS ARBITRATION AGREEMENT MUST BE ARBITRATED OR LITIGATED ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS AND NOT ON A CLASS BASIS. CLAIMS OF MORE THAN ONE CUSTOMER OR USER CANNOT BE ARBITRATED OR LITIGATED JOINTLY OR CONSOLIDATED WITH THOSE OF ANY OTHER CUSTOMER OR USER. If however, this waiver of class or consolidated actions is deemed invalid or unenforceable, neither you nor Canopy is entitled to arbitration; instead all claims and disputes will be resolved in a court as set forth in (g) below.<strong> </strong></p><p><em>(f) Opt-out. </em>You have the right to opt out of the provisions of this Section by sending written notice of your decision to opt out to the following address: 20 Jay St., Suite 520, Brooklyn, NY 11201 postmarked within thirty (30) days of first accepting these Terms. You must include (i) your name and residence address, (ii) the email address and/or telephone number associated with your account, and (iii) a clear statement that you want to opt out of these Terms’ arbitration agreement.</p><p><em>(h) Severability. </em>If the prohibition against class actions and other claims brought on behalf of third parties contained above is found to be unenforceable, then all of the preceding language in this Arbitration Agreement section will be null and void. This arbitration agreement will survive the termination of your relationship with Canopy.</p><p><em>(g) Exclusive Venue.</em> If you send the opt-out notice in (f), and/or in any circumstances where the foregoing arbitration agreement permits either you or Canopy to litigate any dispute arising out of or relating to the subject matter of these Terms in court, then the foregoing arbitration agreement will not apply to either party, and both you and Canopy agree that any judicial proceeding (other than small claims actions) will be brought in the state or federal courts located in, respectively, New York County, New York, or the federal district in which that county falls.</p><h4>Assignment</h4><p>You may not assign, delegate or transfer these Terms or your rights or obligations hereunder, or your Services account, in any way (by operation of law or otherwise) without Canopy&#x27;s prior written consent. We may transfer, assign, or delegate these Terms and our rights and obligations without consent.</p><h4>Personal Data of Children</h4><p>As noted here and in the Privacy Policy [add link], we do not want your Personal Data. And so we do not knowingly collect or solicit personally identifiable information from anyone (unless you want to provide us with your email address), including children under 13. If you are a child under 13, please do not send us any personal information, including your email address.  If we learn that a child under 13 has sent us any personal information, we will delete that information as quickly as possible. If you believe that a child under 13 may have provided us personal information, please contact us at <a href="mailto:hello@canopy.cr.">hello@canopy.cr</a>.</p><h4>The rest</h4><p>These Terms and the other material referenced in them are the entire agreement between you and Canopy with respect to the Services. They supersede all other communications and proposals (whether oral, written, or electronic) between you and Canopy with respect to the Services and govern our future relationship. If any provision of these Terms is found to be invalid under the law, that provision will be limited or eliminated to the minimum extent necessary so that the Terms otherwise will remain in full force and effect and enforceable. The failure of either you or Canopy to exercise any right provided for in these Terms in any way won’t be deemed a waiver of any other rights.</p><p>These Terms are personal to you. You can’t assign them, transfer them, or sublicense them unless you get Canopy’s prior written consent. Canopy has the right to assign, transfer, or delegate any of its <strong>rights</strong> and obligations under these Terms without your consent. Canopy will provide you notice via conspicuously posting the notice on our Site or App.</p><p class="caption">Effective Date: September 17, 2019<br/>Last Updated: September 17, 2019<br/></p></div></div><div class="footer-new"><div class="container footer-new"><div class="footer-grid"><div class="footer-column"><h6 class="h6">Canopy</h6><a href="index.html" class="footer-p">Canopy</a><a href="blog.html" class="footer-p">Blog</a><a href="privacy-policy.html" class="footer-p">Privacy Policy</a><a href="/terms.html" aria-current="page" class="footer-p w--current">Terms of Service</a></div><div class="footer-column"><h6 class="h6">Company</h6><a href="/about.html#values" class="footer-p">Values</a><a href="/about.html#team" class="footer-p">Team</a><a href="/about.html#investors" class="footer-p">Investors</a></div><div class="footer-column"><h6 class="h6">Tonic</h6><a href="beta.html" class="footer-p">About</a><a href="beta.html#faq" class="footer-p">FAQs</a><a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/tonic-find-the-good/id1475936325" target="_blank" class="footer-p">App Store</a><a href="https://twitter.com/tonic_app" class="footer-p">Twitter</a></div><div class="footer-column"><h6 class="h6">Community</h6><a href="https://twitter.com/ourcanopy" target="_blank" class="footer-p">Twitter</a><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/canopycrestcorporation/" target="_blank" class="footer-p">LinkedIn</a></div><div class="footer-column mobile-hide"><h6 class="h6">Contact</h6><a href="mailto:support@canopy.cr" class="footer-p">Support</a><a href="mailto:press@canopy.cr" class="footer-p">Press</a></div></div><div class="footer-bottom"><div id="w-node-ffefbf22a389-bf22a349" class="footer-p copyright">© 2020 Canopy Crest Corporation</div></div></div></div><script src="https://d3e54v103j8qbb.cloudfront.net/js/jquery-3.4.1.min.220afd743d.js?site=5d7c16dc5b749346cfa3d045" type="text/javascript" integrity="sha256-CSXorXvZcTkaix6Yvo6HppcZGetbYMGWSFlBw8HfCJo=" crossorigin="anonymous"></script><script src="/assets/5d7c16dc5b749346cfa3d045/js/canopy-site.2ebb9646d.js" type="text/javascript"></script><!--[if lte IE 9]><script src="//cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/placeholders/3.0.2/placeholders.min.js"></script><![endif]--></body></html>
