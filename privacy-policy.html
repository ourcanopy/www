Tonic uses Canopy’s private, explainable and controllable architecture to give you delightful personalized experiences without compromising your identity (the “Services”). At Canopy, we take your privacy seriously and do not collect, share or store your personal information.</p><h4 id="about-this-policy" class="privacy-h4">What this Privacy Policy Covers</h4><p>At Canopy, we want to put you in control of your Personal Data, and this Privacy Policy explains how we do that when you use or access our Services. “Personal Data” means any information that identifies or relates to a particular individual and also includes information referred to as “personally identifiable information” or “personal information” under applicable data privacy laws, rules, or regulations, such as the California Consumer Privacy Act of 2018 (the “CCPA”). To be clear, this Privacy Policy is about what Canopy is doing to keep your Personal Data safe and secure.  This Privacy Policy does not cover the practices of companies we don’t own or control or people who we don’t manage.</p><h4 id="how-we-receive-information" class="privacy-h4">Canopy and Differential Privacy</h4><p>Canopy does not and will not track or store any information about your activity.  Part of how we do this is by using differential privacy, which is a way of aggregating preferences of people and drawing insights without attributing any of those insights to a particular person.  Differential privacy is a system for publicly sharing information about a dataset by describing the patterns of groups within the dataset while withholding information about individuals in the dataset.  Accordingly, Canopy does not know who you are or how you’re using our Services.</p><p>Typically, businesses store your profile with a long record of your history and activity so they can understand your behavior over time.  This leaves your information vulnerable.  It can be leaked, hacked, given away or sold to others.</p><p>Canopy does not do this.  We believe that you should be in control of your data whether you use an app from us like Tonic, or an app that utilizes our technology.  Further examples of this are below:</p><p><em>IP Address and Device Information</em>: Any time you use an app or visit a website, your device sends information about it to that app or website’s server (e.g., the IP address, the user agent). This information can often be used to identify you, so our policy is to not to store that information at all on our servers. </p><p><em>Recommendations: </em>We’ve architected Canopy so that you can have a personalized experience while keeping your data and identity secure.  We learn about you using data on your device only.  You can read more about how we do this on our <a href="blog/a-better-way-to-discover-things/index.html">blog</a>.</p><p><em>Anonymous Metrics: </em>We want you to have a great time using our products.  So we built private metrics, which means that we can understand how our product is being used and improve the experience without tracking your every movement.  Most companies collect very detailed information about your interactions with their apps (such as when you access them, what sites you visit, and what purchases you make), and aggregate the data later on their servers to understand how people use their apps.  We decide ahead of time what aggregations to make, and perform those aggregations on your phone.  The aggregated metrics are sent to our servers when you request recommendations, and are stored without any other identifying information.  Some examples of metrics that we collect are: number of days active out of the last 30 days, average discoveries read, etc.  We use these metrics to understand broad trends in app usage over time, to help us ensure that we’re giving our users the best experience each day.<em>  </em></p><p><em>Private Browser: </em>We’ve built a private browser into the Tonic app, which means that when you access websites in our app, they can’t track you with cookies.</p><h4 id="what-we-do" class="privacy-h4">Email addresses</h4><p>To use Canopy’s Services, you do not need to log-in, create a user account or give us your email address.  However, you may choose to provide us with your email address in Tonic in connection with a support request (you can also report an issue anonymously) or on our website if you want to receive updates from us via email.  You do not have to, and to be frank, we don’t really want your email addresses!  This is why we’ve made it possible to report bugs or provide feedback anonymously.    <br/></p><p>Email addresses are Personal Data, and so we treat them with care.  We do not disclose your Personal Data to third parties for business purposes.  We do not sell your Personal Data.  If you want us to delete your email address, please contact us at <a href="mailto:hello@canopy.cr">hello@canopy.cr</a>.<br/></p><h4 id="choices" class="privacy-h4">Other important information</h4><h5 class="terms-h5">Legal Requests</h5><p><em>‍</em>We will comply with legal requests when we have a legal obligation to do so.  But they can’t request what we don’t have, and we don’t expect to be able to provide anything. <br/></p><h5 class="terms-h5">Updates</h5><p>We’re constantly trying to improve our Services, so we may update this Privacy Policy.  Any changes will become effective when we post the revised Privacy Policy, and we’ll announce it to let you know.  If you keep using Canopy after a change, that means you accept all of the changes.  If you don’t agree with the changes, that’s ok!  It just means you can no longer use our Services.<br/>‍<br/></p><h5 class="terms-h5">Personal Data of Children<br/></h5><p>As noted here and in the <a href="/terms.html">Terms of Use</a>, we do not want your Personal Data.  And so we do not knowingly collect or solicit personally identifiable information from anyone (unless you want to provide us with your email address), including children under 13.  If you are a child under 13, please do not send us any personal information, including your email address.  If we learn that a child under 13 has sent us any personal information, we will delete that information as quickly as possible.  If you believe that a child under 13 may have provided us personal information, please contact us at <a href="mailto:hello@canopy.cr">hello@canopy.cr</a>.<br/></p><h4 id="how-long-we-keep-information" class="privacy-h4">Questions?</h4><p>The magic of Canopy is having a personalized experience that keeps your data in your hands and out of ours. If you have any questions about how this works, please <a href="mailto:hello@canopy.cr">reach out to us</a>. We are building a new way, one where the internet is private-by-default, and we’re more than happy to talk about it.</p><p class="caption">Effective Date: September 17, 2019<br/>Last Updated: September 17, 2019<br/></p></div></div><div class="footer-new"><div class="container footer-new"><div class="footer-grid"><div class="footer-column"><h6 class="h6">Canopy</h6><a href="index.html" class="footer-p">Canopy</a><a href="blog.html" class="footer-p">Blog</a><a href="privacy-policy.html" aria-current="page" class="footer-p w--current">Privacy Policy</a><a href="/terms.html" class="footer-p">Terms of Service</a></div><div class="footer-column"><h6 class="h6">Company</h6><a href="/about.html#values" class="footer-p">Values</a><a href="/about.html#team" class="footer-p">Team</a><a href="/about.html#investors" class="footer-p">Investors</a></div><div class="footer-column"><h6 class="h6">Tonic</h6><a href="beta.html" class="footer-p">About</a><a href="beta.html#faq" class="footer-p">FAQs</a><a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/tonic-find-the-good/id1475936325" target="_blank" class="footer-p">App Store</a><a href="https://twitter.com/tonic_app" class="footer-p">Twitter</a></div><div class="footer-column"><h6 class="h6">Community</h6><a href="https://twitter.com/ourcanopy" target="_blank" class="footer-p">Twitter</a><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/canopycrestcorporation/" target="_blank" class="footer-p">LinkedIn</a></div><div class="footer-column mobile-hide"><h6 class="h6">Contact</h6><a href="mailto:support@canopy.cr" class="footer-p">Support</a><a href="mailto:press@canopy.cr" class="footer-p">Press</a></div></div><div class="footer-bottom"><div id="w-node-ffefbf22a389-bf22a349" class="footer-p copyright">© 2020 Canopy Crest Corporation</div></div></div></div><script src="https://d3e54v103j8qbb.cloudfront.net/js/jquery-3.4.1.min.220afd743d.js?site=5d7c16dc5b749346cfa3d045" type="text/javascript" integrity="sha256-CSXorXvZcTkaix6Yvo6HppcZGetbYMGWSFlBw8HfCJo=" crossorigin="anonymous"></script><script src="/assets/5d7c16dc5b749346cfa3d045/js/canopy-site.2ebb9646d.js" type="text/javascript"></script><!--[if lte IE 9]><script src="//cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/placeholders/3.0.2/placeholders.min.js"></script><![endif]--></body></html>
